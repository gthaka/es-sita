# es-sita

In the process of Learning JS, I find myself having to do some unlearning in order to move forward<br/>
I look into ES6 and what I might not have learnt / understood back then.  
'.. knowledge consolidation process' \
Wish Me Luck

Thanks to [this YouTube tutorial on main components of ES6](https://youtu.be/nZ1DMMsyVyI)
